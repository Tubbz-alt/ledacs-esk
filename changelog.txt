V0.22 Build 2020.08.17
Minor code cleaning and tweaking
Cleaned up Debug and simplified
Debug 0 = No verbosity
Debug 1 = SR output for Idle and Voice and legacy AFS info
Debug 2 = Display all commands received, status, and SR, plus debug 1

Tinkering with .detector script sample output sound rate (boosted to 48000 mono out)

V0.21 Build 2020.08.15
Fix bug in ledacs-esk-analyzer that didn't show calls placed due to removal of LCNs
Implemented lshifter as an internal variable that changes based on which EDACS system is specified.

v0.2 Build 2020.08.12

Implimented allow/deny lists for groups and senders
Cleaned up or removed lots of code and comments
Removed all code related to PATCH, ID, DATA, and other commands as they were too complex
Removed distinction between a normal call and a PVT call, since it didn't seem reliable
Renamed standalone.sh to analyzer.sh, so I could call ./start.sh with tabs faster
Renamed ledacs-esk-standalone to ledacs-esk-analyzer for consistency
Other minor tweaks/fixes 
Inadvertent new bugs probably


Known Issues:

1.) Site ID, LCN, Group, Sender, or other values may temporarily report an incorrect number.

This issue is primarily due to a lack of any real error detection, if the signal or samples read in that 
exact moment by the software are 'off', then incorect values may temporarily show up.  Due to the simplicity
of this software, this issue will most likely not be fixed, but shouldn't greatly affect the performance
of the software. For now, best fix may be to ensure good signal with your dongle, adjust position/antenna
if its convenient.

2.) Voice channels may open for groups/senders in the deny list

This is due to two factors, the first, as above, iccorect values streaming into the software, it may open
the channel for a bogus group or sender if it didn't read it correctly. Second, the manner of checkdown
that occurs checking the current group versus the deny list, it may open up if the group or sender is
further down the list. A 'quick fix' was implimented to set the squelch high to close the channel, but
this may introduce new issues such as closing a desired voice channel when the denied group/sender
attempts to speak up at the same time.

3.) Allow List overrides Deny list

If you have items in the allow list and the deny list, the deny list will be ignored in favor of the
allow list. This is by design, Allow list only allows what you manually specify, denying everything
else. 

4.) Segmentation fault if incorrect variables are given at command prompt or in start.sh, standalone.sh.

I haven't had time to rewrite the arguments portion of the software, partially out of not wanting to 
break more stuff and end up banging my head against my desk trying to figure it out. Been focused more
on getting what works to work better and stripping out things that don't work so well. Also, I'm not
a good programmer, laziness, busy, etc. etc. Just be sure to use all the required arguments for now. 

5.) Unknown functionality with other variants of EDACS

Currently, this software has only been tested against a few EDACS ESK control channels, since
I don't have any other EDACS in my home area, I have yet to be able to test it against the
original and other variants of EDACS. Any feedback would be appreciated. If nothing happens
for you and you are sure you are tuned to a EDACS CC, then please run debug options on for verbose
details and feel free to submit them. 

rtl_fm -d 0 -f 851375000 -s 28.8k -p 0.5 -g 49 | ./ledacs-esk site243 1 1 3 allow deny >> debug.txt

Run something similar to above for a few moments and then ctrl-c to close it, then submit the 
debug.txt file with a description of the type of EDACS system, any known site ID, etc.
