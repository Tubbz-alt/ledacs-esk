Hello,

I am including this text file as a bit of an about the software file and a history file.

That being said, much of the software is a bit of a mystery and lacking in history.
I found this software "ledacs" on github at the link:

https://github.com/sp5wwp/ledacs

This software didnt' have but 1 star, (I'm the second) and one fork (mine).
I attempted to contact the poster about this software but never heard back.
I wanted to ascertain the status of the software, and more importantly, ask
questions about it, and if it was originally somebody elses software, etc.

The github sp5wwp/ledacs had a polish readme file that I was oringally able to 
read through google translate, which helped me to begin to understand how this
software worked and how to operate it. That being said, it didnt' seem to include
any contact information or developer information. I have also attempted to contact
sp5wwp by raising an 'issue' on the github but have not heard back. The software on
the github was uploaded on October 21, 2018 and has not had any activity after the 
initial upload.

The original 'main.c' file found in the 'decoder' folder has a preamble at the top 
which reads:

/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 								EDACS96 rtl_fm decoder
 * 
 * 
 * rtl_fm sample rate 28.8kHz (3*9600baud - 3 samples per symbol)
 * 
 * 
 * XTAL Labs
 * 3 V 2016
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

I have attempted to google search for XTAL Labs using different combinations of 
search queries and have not found any website, github, forum postings, etc. Therefore,
I can't make contact with anybody there to see if they own this software.

The github link above had an EDACS_en.txt file which had a lot of information about
EDACS systems and in particular the structure of packets and how EDACS worked and layed out a 
foundation for how to write software for EDACS, and included an email address. The next section
then spoke THE PROGRAM and I began to wonder if the software at the github link was written by 
the same person as the text file, and included a juno email address,
so I emailed this person to see if they were the original software
writer of either component of ledacs, or the dot-sequence program. I received the reply:

Address not found
Your message wasn't delivered to qwertyuiop10@juno.com because the address couldn't be found, or is unable to receive mail.

Finally, My last idea was to look at other software including Etrunker or any others to see if they
had any open souce code to compare against to figure out whether or not they either used or 
created this software. I could find no such information on the matter. I've also inquired at 
Radio Reference in their forums and have found no leads to go on from there.

In short, why am I writing all of this? I want to make absolute certain that this software isn't
infringing on anybody's intellectual property and that it has an open source license of some type
that does in fact allow me to modify and redistribute this software. As I have not been able to 
make contact with anybody and only have the UNLICENSE LICENSE on sp5wwp/ledacs github, I am
modifying and distributing this software with the same UNLICENSE LICENSE that I found it with.
